The project aims to establish a climate of discussion, which favors opportunities for artistic enrichment through continuous stimuli and, ultimately, which presents effective feedback in the field of newly created art music.',
            'about-paragraph1.2' : 'The ensemble of performers is made up of young musicians interested in the contemporary repertoire who wish to undertake a journey of exploration of new music in all its forms, styles and languages. The composers are also an integral part of the ensemble: their presence within the collective gives them the possibility of working in a climate of discussion and continuous artistic stimulation, creating their works in close contact with the performers, who will be able to lead them to a more conscious and idiomatic writing of the instruments themselves.',
            'about-paragraph1.3' : 'This collective does not present itself as an associative reality of the Third Sector. This choice derives mainly from the fact that setting up an association from scratch would have caused, at least in an initial phase, a considerable expenditure of time and energy which can and must be invested in composing and playing. However, the collective aims to establish solid contacts with existing associations that have common objectives and that express themselves favorably in collaborating with the ensemble and in providing any economic/financial support (adhesion to tenders/fund requests).',
            'about-paragraph1.4' : 'The need to promote ensembles specialized in contemporary repertoire, even more so if they push composers to produce new music, is becoming increasingly evident in recent times. In fact, contemporary music presents specific difficulties that are very different from those of the "classical" repertoire, just think of the increase in a sound vocabulary resulting from the birth of new performance techniques, requiring a high degree of specialization and interest. To restore to this music the greater respect and care that it requires, it appears essential that the ensembles dedicate themselves to it in a targeted manner, working in close contact with the composers for the time necessary to assimilate their creative thought. Furthermore, the Bottega Sonora Ensemble project starts from the idea of ​​first involving the main cultural centers of central Italy, where contemporary music does not always find fertile ground, but indeed often plays a rather marginal role. Fighting the ideal that this type of music can only be made outside our country will be one of our first concerns, without however precluding possible collaborations with institutions/composers everywhere.',

Furthermore, the possibility of carrying out work on the recovery and valorisation of lesser-known scores from the last century is not excluded.',
            'about-bullet-2' : "The creation of new unpublished works by composers represents a further crucial prerogative in the ensemble's activities. In addition to the constant work with the composers of the collective, new works will be requested from composers already included in the national and international scene, through direct knowledge or by publishing 'call for scores' for recordings and/or concerts and events proposed by them.",
            'about-bullet-3' : "Dissemination represents a fundamental aspect within the collective's artistic activity and aims to facilitate accessibility to contemporary music, both in terms of availability of the repertoire and the offer of new interpretations). The intention is to disseminate as much as possible the works carried out by the ensemble in the various forms provided by the media and spaces used for cultural activities: content on social media, podcasts, conferences and interventions during concerts, listening guides and training activities further within schools and conservatories. In fact, we believe that this awareness must start from the educational system itself, starting from the AFAM institutes, where young people too often are not introduced to and/or educated about contemporary music (in some situations they are even discouraged) if not by mere chance.",
            'about-bullet-4' : "The support of contemporary music bodies and institutions operating on national soil will be fundamental for the organization and realization of concerts, events, recordings and research projects.

Il progetto mira ad instaurare un clima di confronto, che favorisca delle opportunità di arricchimento artistico mediante continui stimoli e, in ultimo,  che presenti dei riscontri effettivi nel campo della musica d’arte di nuova realizzazione .',

Anche i compositori  sono parte integrante dell'ensemble: la loro presenza all’interno del  collettivo  da infatti loro la possibilità di lavorare in un clima di confronto e di continua stimolazione artistica  realizzando le proprie opere a stretto contatto con gli esecutori, i quali potranno condurli a una scrittura più consapevole e  idiomatica degli strumenti stessi.",
            'about-paragraph1.3' : 'Tale collettivo non si pone come realtà associativa del Terzo Settore. Questa scelta deriva principalmente dal fatto che  costituire un’associazione da zero avrebbe causato, almeno in una fase iniziale, un notevole dispendio di tempo ed energie che possono e devono essere investiti per comporre e per suonare. Tuttavia il collettivo mira ad instaurare solidi contatti con realtà associative esistenti che abbiano obiettivi comuni e che si esprimano favorevolmente nel collaborare con l’ensemble e nel fornire eventuale supporto economico/finanziario (adesione bandi/richieste fondi).',
            'about-paragraph1.4' : "La necessità di promuovere ensemble specializzati nel repertorio contemporaneo, ancora di più se spingono i compositori a produrre musica nuova, si sta palesando sempre di più negli ultimi tempi. La musica contemporanea infatti presenta difficoltà specifiche anche molto diverse da quelle del repertorio “classico”, si pensi solo all’incremento di un vocabolario sonoro scaturito dalla nascita di nuove tecniche esecutive, richiedendo un alto grado di specializzazione ed interesse. Per restituire a questa musica il maggior rispetto e la cura che essa necessita, appare  indispensabile che gli ensemble vi si dedichino in maniera mirata, lavorando a stretto contatto con i compositori per il tempo necessario ad  assimilare il loro pensiero creativo. Inoltre, il progetto del Bottega Sonora Ensemble parte dall'idea di coinvolgere in primo luogo i principali poli culturali dell’Italia centrale, dove la musica contemporanea non sempre trova terreno fertile, ma anzi spesso ricopre un ruolo piuttosto marginale. Combattere l’ideale che questo tipo di musica si possa fare solo fuori dal nostro paese sarà una delle nostre prime preoccupazioni, senza però precludere eventuali collaborazioni con enti/compositori di ogni dove.",
            'about-paragraph1.4' : 'The need to promote ensembles specialized in contemporary repertoire, even more so if they push composers to produce new music, is becoming increasingly evident in recent times. In fact, contemporary music presents specific difficulties that are very different from those of the "classical" repertoire, just think of the increase in a sound vocabulary resulting from the birth of new performance techniques, requiring a high degree of specialization and interest. To restore to this music the greater respect and care that it requires, it appears essential that the ensembles dedicate themselves to it in a targeted manner, working in close contact with the composers for the time necessary to assimilate their creative thought. Furthermore, the Bottega Sonora Ensemble project starts from the idea of ​​first involving the main cultural centers of central Italy, where contemporary music does not always find fertile ground, but indeed often plays a rather marginal role. Fighting the ideal that this type of music can only be made outside our country will be one of our first concerns, without however precluding possible collaborations with institutions/composers everywhere.',

            'about-bullet-3' : "La divulgazione rappresenta un aspetto fondamentale all’interno dell’attività artistica del collettivo e si pone con l'obiettivo di facilitare l'accessibilità alla musica contemporanea, sia in termini di reperibilità del repertorio che di offerta di nuove chiavi di lettura). L’intenzione è quella di divulgare il più possibile i lavori svolti dall’ensemble  nelle varie forme fornite dai media e dagli spazi adibiti ad attività culturali: contenuti sui social, podcast, conferenze ed interventi durante i concerti, guide all’ascolto ed attività formative ulteriori all’interno di scuole e conservatori.
